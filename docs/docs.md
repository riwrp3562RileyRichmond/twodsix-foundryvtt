# Twodsix System
A Foundry VTT system for running games using various 2d6-based role-playing games. (See [README.md](../README.md) and the [WIKI](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki) for more information.)

Instructions on how to set up your game for some of the most common variants can be found in our [WIKI here](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/System-Configuration-Guide).  

Also, see the [PUBLISHERS.md](../PUBLISHERS.md) for details of the rpg publishers that have explicitly granted us permission to support their products.


Twodsix has been translated by users of the system into the following languages:
* English (default)
* Swedish (included)
* Spanish (included)
* German (included)
* Russian (available in the Russian translation module https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ru-RU/)
* If you would like support for some other language, send in a translation to that language and I'll add it to the system. (Or send a link to a module that includes support for your preferred language and I'll link to it.) See [CONTRIBUTING.MD](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Other sources of information
* [The Wiki](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki) contains some guides on how to actually use the system.
* [The user_macros wiki](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/User-Macros) contains useful information about macros contained in the compendium Macros are no longer maintained on GitHub.

## The settings I (xdy) use
Fwiw, this is how I have set up the system - i.e. the setting combination that is the most tested by me... (Showing the system setting key, and the value I have changed it to. Any setting not mentioned has the default value.)
* automateDamageRollOnHit:true
* difficultiesAsTargetNumber:true
* effectOrTotal:true
* ExperimentalFeatures:true
* modifierForZeroCharacteristic:-3
* termForAdvantage:Boon
* termForDisadvantage:Bane

## The modules I consider essential
Dice So Nice!, Compendium Folders, DF Settings Clarity, Dice Tray, Forien's Quest Log, Illandril's Chat Enhancements, Inline Web Viewer, PDFoundry, Permission Viewer, PopOut!, Tidy UI

## The modules I really like, but guess I could do without
Autocomplete Whispers, Combat Numbers, DF Scene Enhancement, Forien's Copy Enviromment, FX Master, GM Notes, GM Screen, ModBox, Token Mold.

Also, on our discord (https://discord.gg/KUAwPrj) check out the release notes in #announcements as that is pretty much the only documentation other than this document and the text on the various system settings.
