# Twodsix System
A Foundry VTT system for running games using various 2d6-based role-playing games. (See [README.md](../README.md) and the [WIKI](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki) for more information.)

Instructions on how to set up your game for some of the most common variants can be found in our [WIKI here](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/System-Configuration-Guide).

Also, see the [PUBLISHERS.md](../PUBLISHERS.md) for details of the rpg publishers that have explicitly granted us permission to support their products.

Twodsix has been translated by users of the system into the following languages:
* English (default)
* Swedish (included)
* Spanish (included)
* German (included)
* Russian (available in the Russian translation module https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ru-RU/)
* If you would like support for some other language, send in a translation to that language and I'll add it to the system. (Or send a link to a module that includes support for your preferred language and I'll link to it.) See [CONTRIBUTING.MD](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
