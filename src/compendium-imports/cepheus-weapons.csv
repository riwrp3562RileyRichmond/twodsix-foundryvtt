"Cudgel",0,1,10,"3d6","B",9,"melee","close or thrown","","","A basic stick used as a weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or through the use of an unloaded long gun such as a rifle or carbine (laser weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels). Length: 1000 to 2000mm."
"Dagger",0,0.25,10,"1d6","P",5,"melee","reach or thrown","","","A small knife weapon with a flat, two-edged blade approximately 200mm in length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath, or less frequently concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the forearm. Daggers are usually as much a tool as a last-resort weapon of defense, and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight, however, does not count against the weight load of the character as the weapon is worn constantly and comfortably."
"Spear",0,1.5,10,"3d6","P",8,"melee","reach","","","A weapon with a long shaft and a pointed tip, typically of metal, used for thrusting or throwing. Length: 3000mm."
"Pike",1,8,40,"4d6","P",8,"melee","reach","","","A two-handed weapon with a pointed steel or iron head on a long wooden shaft. Length: 3000 to 4000mm."
"Sword",1,1,150,"3d6","P/S",8,"melee","reach","","","The standard long-edged weapon, featuring a flat, two-edged blade. It may or may not have a basket hilt or hand protector. A scabbard to carry the sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps (or a sash) over the shoulder. Blade length may vary from 700 to 950mm."
"Broadsword",2,3,300,"4d6","S",8,"melee","reach","","","The largest of the sword weapons, also called the two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a cross-piece only, with little basketwork or protection.  When carried, the broadsword is worn in a metal scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder."
"Halberd",2,3,75,"4d6","S",8,"melee","reach","","","A two-handed pole weapon having an axe-like blade and a steel spike mounted on the end of a long shaft. Length: 2500mm."
"Bayonet",3,0.25,10,"1d6","P",5,"melee","close","","","A small knife-like weapon similar to a dagger, frequently attached to a rifle. When not attached to a rifle, the bayonet performs as a dagger."
"Blade",3,0.35,50,"2d6","P",8,"melee","reach","","","A hybrid knife weapon with a heavy, flat two-edged blade nearly 300mm in length, and (often, but not always) a semi-basket handguard. Because of the bulk of the handguard, it is generally carried in a belt scabbard. Blades are as much survival tools as weapons, and are often found in emergency kits, lifeboats etc."
"Cutlass",3,1.25,100,"3d6","S",8,"melee","reach","","","A heavy, flat-bladed, single-edged weapon featuring a full basket hilt to protect the hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard blade weapon and sometimes kept in lockers on the bulkhead near important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used. Blade length varies from 600 to 900mm."
"Foil",3,0.5,100,"3d6","P",8,"melee","reach","","","Also known as the rapier, this weapon is a light, sword-like weapon with a pointed, edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup hilt to protect the hand. Foils are worn in scabbards attached to the belt."
"Bow",1,1,60,"2d6","P",6,"ranged","assault weapon","1",true,"A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific shape and strung with a piece of cord, string or gut to increase tension. The string is pulled back and released to hurl an arrow long distances with surprising force. At higher technology levels, bows are modified with additional strings and pulley systems to add accuracy and power."
"Crossbow",2,3,75,"2d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1",true,"A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing mechanism and stronger-than-normal pull, crossbows are very powerful weapons that are very time consuming to reload. At higher technology levels, crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems that make the weapons easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9. Reloading a TL2 crossbow takes 6 minor actions, at TL4 this is reduced to 3 minor actions."
"Revolver",3,0.9,150,"2d6","P",6,"ranged","pistol","1",true,"An early handgun, the revolver fires 9mm bullets with characteristics similar to those used by the automatic pistol but not interchangeable with them. No magazine is used: six cartridges are inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading takes two combat rounds, or one combat round if the individual foregoes the benefit of evasion."
"Auto Pistol",5,0.75,200,"2d6","P",6,"ranged","pistol","1",true,"Also referred to as a Semi-Automatic Pistol, Automatic Pistol or just a Pistol, the auto pistol is a basic repeating handgun. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Auto pistol ammunition is interchangeable with submachinegun ammunition (although magazines are not). Preloaded magazines may be inserted into an empty pistol, but require a reload action to complete."
"Carbine",5,3,200,"2d6","P",6,"ranged","shotgun","1",true,"A short type of rifle firing a small caliber round. A magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into the underside of the carbine ahead of the trigger guard or behind the handgrip (this configuration is referred to as “Bullpup”, and in some localities carbines may be referred to as Bullpups), and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine takes a reload action. Carbine ammunition is not interchangeable with any other type of ammunition. In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a cartridge of smaller, lighter caliber. A sling usually allows the carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out of the way."
"Rifle",5,4,200,"3d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1",true,"The standard military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet at a velocity of approximately 900 meters per second. Longer and heavier than a carbine, it is also more effective. Standard equipment includes provisions for attaching a bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder sling. A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the trigger guard, and one round is fired with each pull of the trigger. Replacement of the empty magazine requires a reload action. Rifle ammunition may also be used in automatic rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable, and weigh the same."
"Shotgun",5,3.75,150,"4d6","P",7,"ranged","shotgun","1",true,"The basic weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one hundred and thirty 3mm pellets. In each case, the projectiles weigh a total of 30 grams. Velocity for the projectiles is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical magazine containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the shotgun for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired for each pull of the trigger. Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by 20mm in diameter and are quite clumsy to carry. Shotguns are equipped with a sling for carrying."
"Submachinegun",5,2.5,50,"2d6","P",4,"ranged","assault weapon","0/4",true,"A small automatic weapon designed to fire pistol ammunition. Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip, depending on the design. The gun fires a burst of four rounds per pull of the trigger. Replacement of an empty magazine requires one combat round. Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines) is interchangeable with autopistol ammunition. Most submachineguns are equipped with slings for ease of carrying. Some are small enough to be carried in a shoulder or hip holster."
"Auto Rifle",6,5,1000,"3d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1-4",true,"A highly refined and tuned version of the rifle, capable of full automatic fire as well as semiautomatic shots. Normally, the automatic rifle fires bursts of four bullets for each pull of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic fire at the end of a combat round, after all firing, in which case it is treated as a rifle until switched back to burst mode. Ammunition and magazines are identical to those used for the rifle."
"Assault Rifle",7,3,300,"3d6","P",4,"ranged","assault weapon","1-4",true,"A lighter and less expensive version of the automatic rifle."
"Body Pistol",7,0.25,50,"2d6","P",1,"ranged","pistol","1",true,"A small, non-metallic semiautomatic pistol designed to evade detection by most weapon detectors. One cartridge is fired for each pull of the trigger. Pre-loaded magazines may be inserted into the pistol when it is empty, requiring a reload action to do so. Body pistol ammunition is not interchangeable with the ammunition for any other types of guns."
"Laser Carbine",8,5,2500,"4d6","P",2,"ranged","pistol","1",false,"A lightweight version of the laser rifle, firing high energy bolts using current from a backpack battery/power pack. The laser carbine fires a 2mm beam of energy, aimed by integrated optic sights. The power pack is capable of producing 50 shots before it requires recharging. Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a high-energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable."
"Snub Pistol",8,0.25,150,"2d6","E",6,"ranged","pistol","1",false,"A low velocity revolver designed for use shipboard and in zero-g environments."
"Accelerator Rifle",9,2.5,900,"3d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1-3",false,"Designed specifically for zero-g combat, the accelerator rifle fires a specially designed round which upon leaving the barrel is accelerated by a secondary propelling charge. Normally the rifle fires bursts of three rounds per pull of the trigger, but may be adjusted to fire single rounds."
"Laser Rifle",9,6,3500,"5d6","E",2,"ranged","rifle","1",false,"The standard high energy weapon, firing energy bolts in the same manner as the laser carbine. Heavier, the laser rifle is also capable of longer sustained action, and is somewhat sturdier. The power pack can provide 100 shots before recharging. As in the laser carbine, the laser rifle is connected to the power pack by a heavy-duty cable. Power packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons, however."
"Advanced Combat Rifle",10,3.5,1000,"3d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1-4",true,"A progressive development of the assault rifle."
"Gauss Rifle",12,3.5,1500,"4d6","P",6,"ranged","rifle","1-4-10",false,"The ultimate development of the slug thrower, the gauss rifle generates an electromagnetic field along the length of the barrel which accelerates a bullet to high velocities. The round itself consists of a dense armor piercing core surrounded by a softer metal covering, ending in a hollow point, giving the round excellent stopping power and good armor penetration."
"Laser Pistol",12,1.2,1000,"4d6","E",2,"ranged","pistol","1",false,"A pistol equivalent of the laser carbine, though still dependent on an external power pack."
"PGMP",12,10,20000,"10d6","E","2","ranged","rifle","1-4",true,"It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it."
"FGMP",14,12,100000,"16d6","E","2","ranged","rifle","1-4",true,"It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2D6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity."
