# 2d6 system
A system for running games using the world's oldest science fiction rpg system and it's various derivatives.

Note that it is *very* early in it's development. As in, it doesn't really do anything useful yet...

At first it will support doing things the way I do it using my favorite 2d6 rules variant, but I intend to make it flexible 
enough that all/most 2d6 rules variants should be possible to play using this system. Due to licensing restrictions the
user may have to enter some compendiums. 

This system may eventually claim compatibility with specific rules sets once I have:
a) completed said compatibility 
b) actually have the license to do so
